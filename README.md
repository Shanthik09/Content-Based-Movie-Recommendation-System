# Content-Based-Movie-Recommendation-System

In this system userâ€™s interest and profile features are taken into considerations. They make an assumption that if a one has interests in an item, then one will once again be interested in it in the future. Items sharing something in common are usually grouped together based on their features. User profiles are constructed using past interactions or by indirectly asking users about their interests. Other systems, which are not content-based, utilize user personal and social data.

They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
